# math-tables
Learn and self-test the math tables

# URL params
Until I do the admin UI settings are controlled from the URL, eg C:\\Desktop\maths.html?mode=roblox-challenge

## mode=single-level
### single-level mode
The quick one for half of the level eg 1+1 to 1+5 or 3+5 to 3+10.
I used it to before I allow doughter to play on tablet. She has to finish one such level.
That level requires 3 consequitive correct answers.

## roblox-challenge mode
You have to do all the full levels, eg 1+1 to 1+10, 2+1 to 2+10 ... 10+1 to 10+10
You need 3 consequitive correct answers to get to the next level.
I'm planning to add additional requirement, to have also at least 5 correct answers.
After completing this challenge daughter is awarded 400 R$.

This mode ignores the level param.

## level=2 
Starts from specific level, where in *single-level* mode you have half-level, eg 
level 1:  1+1 to 1+5, 
level 2: 1+5 to 1+10
